Finger Camera and Light

This repository contains for now:
- Camera ESP32
- LEDS 
- README file

The Camera ESP32 and LEDS files are both composed of a script that will be used to program the camera part and light part of our full device respectively. The LEDs script has some code already but it's just for testing, this can be modified.
2 different scripts are needed since we will be using 2 different boards to make them work.
Feel all free to create your branch so we can program on our own and then merge once the code is working.
