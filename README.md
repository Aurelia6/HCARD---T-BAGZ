# HCARD---T-BAGZ
Finger Camera and Light

This repository contains for now:
- Camera_ESP32 folder
- LED_ARDUINO folder
- LED_ESP32 folder
- README file
- HCARD Competition Day

The Camera_ESP32 folder contains the code used to make the camera part work.
The LED_ARDUINO and LED_ESP32 fodlers contains code for the light part. The LED_ESP32 contains simple code that works on the ESP32 board – which will not be used for the competition –, while the LED_ARDUINO contains the code used to make the light part work. 2 different files exist since one was for only one light and the other one for 2 lights.
HCARD Competition Day is written in python and is a google colab file. It consists of all the games we are going to play during the competition - with leaderboard and data saving.
