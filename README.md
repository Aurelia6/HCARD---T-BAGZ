Finger Camera and Light

This repository contains for now:
- Camera_ESP32 folder
- LEDS folder
- README file
- SecretCode

The Camera_ESP32 and LEDS folders are both composed of scripts that will be used to program the camera part and light part of our full device respectively. The LEDs script has some code already but it's just for testing, this can and need to be modified.
2 different scripts are needed since we will be using 2 different boards to make them work.
SecretCode is written in python and is a google colab file. It consists of the game we are going to play during the competition.
Feel all free to create your branch so we can program on our own and then merge once the code is working.

We need to buy an FPC Extensor
